# Project specification

    ## What data structures and algorithms will you be using?

        I will be using the asymmetric numeral systems- method to compress files.

    What problem are you solving and why did you chose these specific data structures and algorithms

        I am solving the problem of compressing data to hopefully allow it to take up less space in computer memory or transmit data with a smaller amount of bits.

    What is the program input and how will it be used

        The program input is a file on the user's system

    Expected time and space complexities of the program (big-O notations)
