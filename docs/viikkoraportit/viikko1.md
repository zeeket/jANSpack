    What have you done this week?

    Initial research of the algorithm and how it works.

    How has the project progressed?

    OK considering this is the first week.

    What did you learn this week / today?

    I learned roughly how asymmetric numeral systems work to compress data closer to the theoretical limit. I've never familiarized myself with entropy of bytes and things of that nature, so that was new, too.

    What has been inclear or problematic? Please answer this question truthfully, as this is something the course assistant may be able to help with.




    What next?

writing code and then seeing if it works, writing more code.
