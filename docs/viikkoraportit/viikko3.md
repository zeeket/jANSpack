This week I finished the compression IO and started implementing the ANS algorithm.

    How has the project progressed?

I am almost done with compression, and after that decompression should be fairly trivial

This week I learned that I initially did not correctly understand the ANS algorithm and its variants. Now I have stronger understanding

Unclear and problematic things have been the different variants of the ANS method. There is a tabled variant and the stream variant.

What next?

Finishing the compression very soon (this weekend) adn then starting with the decompression part.


I read the wikipedia article on asymmetric numeral systems again, which helped me.
