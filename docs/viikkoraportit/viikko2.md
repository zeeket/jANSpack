This week I coded most of the underlying I/O structure for the program and studied the algorithm some more. I think I have a pretty good idea of what to do next

# II. ASYMMETRIC NUMERAL SYSTEMS 
"Consider a stationary and memoryless source over a finite alphabet A of size α with probability distribution P:Si:(AP)={0,1,  ...,  α−1p0,p1,  ...,  pα−1},(1)where ps=Pr{Si=s}(s=0,1,...,α−1) is the probability that the ith output Si of the source is equalto s∈A. The ANS encoder maps a sequence from the above source to another sequence of b-ary symbols over the code alphabet {0,1,...,b−1}(b≥2). The source sequence can be uniquely decoded from the codeword, provided that its length is shared by both encoder and decoder."
